A website about a truly terrible MEP. VueJS front end, Hapi/Apollo back end.

## Project setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Environment variables should be set up as per the .env.example file. A MapIt API key is not necessary for development. The front end can be run with Webpack hot reloading with `npm run serve`. The back end can be run with nodemon with `npm run dev`.
